To increase the understanding on how lymph node metastasis impairs the local immune response in affected lymph nodes, we here studied spatial proteomic changes of critical lymph node immune populations in uninvolved lymph nodes (UnLN) and paired lymph nodes with metastases (LNM) from five breast cancer patients. The proteome was analyzed for cortical lymphocyte compartments, subcapsular sinus (SCS) and medullary sinus (MS) CD169 Our results identified a stable proteome of SCS CD169 The findings from our study support the notion that metastasis to lymph nodes in breast cancer patients modifies local immune responses. These changes may contribute to explain unsuccessful therapeutic responses, an",

We used a deep learning (DL) framework to quantify morphological features in haematoxylin and eosin-stained LNs on digitised whole slide images. From 345 breast cancer patients, 5,228 axillary LNs, cancer-free and involved, were assessed. Generalisable multiscale DL frameworks were developed to capture and quantify germinal centres (GCs) and sinuses. Cox regression proportional hazard models tested the association between smuLymphNet-captured GC and sinus quantifications and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). smuLymphNet achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.86 and 0.74 for capturing GCs and ",
