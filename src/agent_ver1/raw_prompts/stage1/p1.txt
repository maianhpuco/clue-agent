Role
You are a board-certified pathologist. The dataset is "{{DATASET_NAME}}",
which has {{NUM_CLASSES}} high-level class(es).

Dataset class descriptions
The following short descriptions summarize the dataset classes and what constitutes positives/negatives. Use them to anchor definitions and include commonly confused morphologies.

{{CLASS_DESCRIPTIONS}}

Goal
For each high-level class, enumerate the key pathology **morphology concepts**
that commonly appear in slide patches (and those that are commonly confused
with them). Include the magnification levels (10x, 20x, 40x) at which each
concept is best recognized.

Return format
OUTPUT JSON ONLY (no prose, no markdown). Return a JSON array where each
item has EXACTLY these fields:

- name                         # string
- definition                   # one short, morphology-dense sentence
- synonyms                     # list[string], deduplicated; lowercase where natural
- concept_type                 # one of {class, compartment, morphology, interface, substructure}
- positives                    # list[string], 3–6 key patch-scale cues present
- negatives                    # list[string], 3–6 confounders/exclusions at patch scale
- magnifications               # list[string], any of ["10x","20x","40x"] where recognition is best

Guidance
- Keep medical wording concise and specific (no narrative).
- Positives/negatives should be patch-scale cues (not diagnoses).
- Include **compartments** (e.g., stroma, lymphoid tissue), **morphologies**
  (e.g., tumor nests, necrosis), and **interfaces** (e.g., tumor–stroma interface).
- If a concept is typically recognized at multiple magnifications, list them all.

Camelyon example (minimum set to include when DATASET_NAME = "Camelyon16")
- Normal (class), Tumor (class),
- Lymphoid tissue (compartment), Adipose tissue (compartment), Stroma (compartment),
- Tumor nest (morphology), Tumor–stroma interface (interface), Necrosis (morphology).
If any are missing, add them with reasonable definitions/synonyms.
