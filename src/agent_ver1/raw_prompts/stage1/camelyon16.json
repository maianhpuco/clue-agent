  "tumor": "CAMELYON16 positive class is metastatic BREAST carcinoma in LYMPH-NODE tissue. Look for epithelial tumor cells within a lymph node: cohesive nests/sheets or glands; pleomorphic atypical nuclei, mitoses; possible necrosis; desmoplastic stromal response; lymphovascular emboli; replacement or distortion of normal nodal architecture; subcapsular/sinusoidal infiltration. Size strata included: isolated tumor cells (ITCs, ≤0.2 mm), micrometastases (>0.2–2 mm), macrometastases (>2 mm). Common mimickers to exclude: benign germinal centers with tingible-body macrophages (\"starry-sky\"), sinus histiocytosis, pigment-laden macrophages, crush/fold artifacts, macrophage aggregates, fat/capsule, granulomas. Evidence should align with epithelial morphology and disruption of lymph-node structure.",
  "normal": "CAMELYON16 negative class is benign/normal LYMPH-NODE tissue with NO metastatic breast carcinoma. Expected findings: preserved nodal architecture (cortex, paracortex, medulla), reactive follicles with polarized germinal centers and tingible-body macrophages, sinus histiocytes, capsule and perinodal fat without invasion, vascular/processing artifacts only. Explicitly absent: cohesive atypical epithelial nests, gland-forming carcinoma cells, lymphovascular tumor emboli, architectural replacement by carcinoma, desmoplastic response. If only ITCs/micro/macro-metastasis-like features are suspected but not convincingly epithelial or not within node, classify as normal pending further evidence."
