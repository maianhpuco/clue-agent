* **Tumor (positive)** in CAMELYON16 = an H&E whole-slide image (WSI) of a **sentinel lymph node that contains metastatic breast carcinoma** (macro- or micro-metastases; isolated tumor cells were annotated in training slides but not treated as a separate positive class in evaluation)
* **Normal (negative)** = an H&E WSI of a **lymph node without metastatic carcinoma** (benign tissue onlyâ€”lymphoid parenchyma, adipose, stroma, etc.).
