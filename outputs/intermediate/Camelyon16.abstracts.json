However, existing mainstream MIL methods focus on modeling correlation between instances while overlooking the inherent diversity among instances. However, few MIL methods have aimed at diversity modeling, which empirically show inferior performance but with a high computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel MIL aggregation method based on diverse global representation (DGR-MIL), by modeling diversity among instances through a set of global vectors that serve as a summary of all instances. First, we turn the instance correlation into the similarity between instance embeddings and the predefined global vectors through a cross-attention mechanism. This stems from the fact that similar instance embeddings typically would result in a higher correlation with a certain global vector. Second, we propose two mechanisms to enforce the diversity among the global vectors to be more descriptive of the entire bag: (i) positive instance alignment and (ii) a novel, efficient, and theoretically guaranteed diversification learning paradigm. Specifically, the positive instance alignment module encourages the global vectors to align with the center of positive instances (e.g., instances containing tumors in WSI). To further diversify the global representations, we propose a novel diversification learning paradigm leveraging the determinantal point process. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL aggregation models by a substantial margin on the CAMELYON-16 and the TCGA-lung cancer datasets.

This development enables comprehensive digital reviews by pathologists and accelerates AI-driven diagnostic support for WSI analysis. Recent advances in foundational pathology models have increased the need for benchmarking tasks. The Camelyon series is one of the most widely used open-source datasets in computational pathology. However, the quality, accessibility, and clinical relevance of the labels have not been comprehensively evaluated.In this study, we reprocessed 1,399 WSIs and labels from the Camelyon-16 and Camelyon-17 datasets, removing low-quality slides, correcting erroneous labels, and providing expert pixel annotations for tumor regions in the previously unreleased test set. Based on the sizes of re-annotated tumor regions, we upgraded the binary cancer screening task to a four-class task: negative, micro-metastasis, macro-metastasis, and Isolated Tumor Cells (ITC). We reevaluated pre-trained pathology feature extractors and multiple instance learning (MIL) methods using the cleaned dataset, providing a benchmark that advances AI development in histopathology.",

While traditional histopathological assessment relies on microscopic examination of stained tissues, the digitization of slides as whole-slide images (WSI) has enabled the development of computer-aided diagnostic systems. These automated approaches offer potential improvements in detection consistency and efficiency compared to conventional methods.\nThis study leverages transfer learning on hematoxylin and eosin (HE) WSIs to achieve computationally efficient metastasis detection without compromising accuracy. We propose an approach for generating segmentation masks by transferring spatial annotations from immunohistochemistry (IHC) WSIs to corresponding H&E slides. Using these masks, four distinct datasets were constructed to fine-tune a pretrained ResNet50 model across eight different configurations, incorporating varied dataset combinations and data augmentation techniques. To enhance interpretability, we developed a visualization tool that employs color-coded probability maps to highlight tumor regions alongside their prediction confidence. Our experiments demonstrated that integrating an external dataset (Camelyon16) during training significantly improved model performance, surpassing the benefits of data augmentation alone. The optimal model, trained on both external and local data, achieved an accuracy and F1-score of 0.98, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.\nThis study demonstrates that transfer learning architectures, when enhanced with multi-source data integration and interpretability frameworks, can significantly improve metastatic detection in whole slide imaging. Our methodology achieves diagnostic performance comparable to gold-standard techniques while dramatically accelerating analytical workflows. The synergistic combination of external dataset incorporation and probabilistic visualization outputs provides a clinically actionable solution that maintains both computational efficiency and pathological interpretability.",
  "40088255": "In cancer pathology diagnosis, analyzing Whole Slide Images (WSI) encounters challenges like invalid data, varying tissue features at different magnifications, and numerous hard samples. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a powerful tool for addressing weakly supervised classification in WSI-based pathology diagnosis. However, existing MIL frameworks cannot simultaneously tackle these issues. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated recognition framework comprising three complementary components: a preprocessing selection method, an Efficient Feature Pyramid Network (EFPN) model for multi-instance learning, and a Similarity Focal Loss. The preprocessing selection method accurately identifies and selects representative image patches, effectively reducing invalid data interference and enhancing subsequent model training efficiency. The EFPN model, inspired by pathologists' diagnostic processes, captures different tissue features in WSI images by constructing a multi-scale feature pyramid, enhancing the model's ability to recognize tumor tissue features. Additionally, the Similarity Focal Loss further improves the model's discriminative power and generalization performance by focusing on hard samples and emphasizing classification boundary information. The test accuracy for binary tumor classification on the CAMELYON16 and two private datasets reached 93.58%, 84.74%, and 99.91%, respectively, all of which outperform existing techniques.",

The lower magnification view provides contextual information for a target area, while the higher magnification view provides detailed information. The model consists of two encoder branches that consider both detail and context resolutions of the target area concurrently for binary pixel-wise segmentation. We introduce a unique weight initialization for the cross-attention between the context and detail feature tensors, allowing the model to incorporate contextual information. Our design is evaluated using the Camelyon16 dataset of sentinel lymph node tissue and cancer. The results demonstrate the benefit of including context regions when segmenting for cancer, with an improvement in AUC ranging from 0.31 to 0.92%Â and an improvement in cancer Dice score ranging from 4.09% to 6.81% compared to single detailed input models.",

Traditional and fully supervised NPC diagnosis algorithms require manual delineation of regions of interest on the gigapixel of whole slide images (WSIs), which however is laborious and often biased. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised framework based on Tokens-to-Token Vision Transformer (WS-T2T-ViT) for accurate NPC classification with only a slide-level label. The label of tile images is inherited from their slide-level label. Specifically, WS-T2T-ViT is composed of the multi-resolution pyramid, T2T-ViT and multi-scale attention module. The multi-resolution pyramid is designed for imitating the coarse-to-fine process of manual pathological analysis to learn features from different magnification levels. The T2T module captures the local and global features to overcome the lack of global information. The multi-scale attention module improves classification performance by weighting the contributions of different granularity levels. Extensive experiments are performed on the 802-patient NPC and CAMELYON16 dataset. WS-T2T-ViT achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.989 for NPC classification on the NPC dataset.

However, with regard to giga-pixel WSI classification problems, current MIL models are often incapable of differentiating a WSI with extremely small tumor lesions. This minute tumor-to-normal area ratio in a MIL bag inhibits the attention mechanism from properly weighting the areas corresponding to minor tumor lesions. To overcome this challenge, we propose salient instance inference MIL (SiiMIL), a weakly-supervised MIL model for WSI classification. We introduce a novel representation learning for histopathology images to identify representative normal keys. These keys facilitate the selection of salient instances within WSIs, forming bags with high tumor-to-normal ratios. Finally, an attention mechanism is employed for slide-level classification based on formed bags. Our results show that salient instance inference can improve the tumor-to-normal area ratio in the tumor WSIs. As a result, SiiMIL achieves 0.9225 AUC and 0.7551 recall on the Camelyon16 dataset, which outperforms the existing MIL models. In addition, SiiMIL can generate tumor-sensitive attention heatmaps that is more interpretable to pathologists than the widely used attention-based MIL method. Our experiments imply that SiiMIL can accurately identify tumor instances, which could only take up less than 1% of a WSI, so that the ratio of tumor to normal instances within a bag can increase by two to four times.",
  "37494153": "Histopathology image classification is an important clinical task, and current deep learning-based whole-slide image (WSI) classification methods typically cut WSIs into small patches and cast the problem as multi-instance learning. The mainstream approach is to train a bag-level classifier, but their performance on both slide classification and positive patch localization is limited because the instance-level information is not fully explored. In this article, we propose a negative instance-guided, self-distillation framework to directly train an instance-level classifier end-to-end. Instead of depending only on the self-supervised training of the teacher and the student classifiers in a typical self-distillation framework, we input the true negative instances into the student classifier to guide the classifier to better distinguish positive and negative instances. In addition, we propose a prediction bank to constrain the distribution of pseudo instance labels generated by the teacher classifier to prevent the self-distillation from falling into the degeneration of classifying all instances as negative. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis on three publicly available pathological datasets: CAMELYON16, PANDA, and TCGA, as well as an in-house pathological dataset for cervical cancer lymph node metastasis prediction.

  "37444538": "The early diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in breast cancer is essential for enhancing treatment outcomes and overall prognosis. Unfortunately, pathologists often fail to identify small or subtle metastatic deposits, leading them to rely on cytokeratin stains for improved detection, although this approach is not without its flaws. To address the need for early detection, multiple-instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the preferred deep learning method for automatic tumor detection on whole slide images (WSIs). However, existing methods often fail to identify some small lesions due to insufficient attention to small regions. Attention-based multiple-instance learning (ABMIL)-based methods can be particularly problematic because they may focus too much on normal regions, leaving insufficient attention for small-tumor lesions. In this paper, we propose a new ABMIL-based model called normal representative keyset ABMIL (NRK-ABMIL), which addresseses this issue by adjusting the attention mechanism to give more attention to lesions. To accomplish this, the NRK-ABMIL creates an optimal keyset of normal patch embeddings called the normal representative keyset (NRK). The NRK roughly represents the underlying distribution of all normal patch embeddings and is used to modify the attention mechanism of the ABMIL. We evaluated NRK-ABMIL on the publicly available Camelyon16 and Camelyon17 datasets and found that it outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in accurately identifying small tumor lesions that may spread over a few patches. Additionally, the NRK-ABMIL also performed exceptionally well in identifying medium/large tumor lesions.",

In this paper, we propose to train a ResNet-34 encoder with an attention-gated classification head in an end-to-end fashion, which we call StreamingCLAM, using a streaming implementation of convolutional layers. This allows us to train end-to-end on 4-gigapixel microscopic images using only slide-level labels. We achieve a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9757 for metastatic breast cancer detection (CAMELYON16), close to fully supervised approaches using pixel-level annotations.

We formally prove that the distribution-based pooling filters are more expressive than the classical point estimate-based counterparts, like 'max' and 'mean' pooling, in terms of the amount of information captured while obtaining bag-level representations. Moreover, we empirically show that models with distribution-based pooling filters perform equal to or better than those with point estimate-based pooling filters on distinct real-world MIL tasks defined on the CAMELYON16 lymph node metastases dataset.

In recent years, deep learning has shown great potential in aiding the diagnosis of pathological images, particularly through the use of convolutional neural networks for locating lymph node metastasis under gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs).

Additionally, the diversity of biological textures and structures within WSIs can cause confusion for classifiers, particularly in identifying hard examples. As a result, the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency remains a critical issue for whole-slide image metastasis localization. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream network that takes a pair of low- and high-magnification image patches as input for identifying hard examples during the training phase. Specifically, our framework focuses on samples where the outputs of the two magnification networks are dissimilar. We adopt a dual magnification hard mining loss to re-weight the ambiguous samples. To more efficiently locate tumor metastasis cells in whole slide images, the two stream networks are decomposed into a cascaded network during the inference phase. The low magnification WSIs scanned by the low-mag network generate a coarse probability map, and the suspicious areas in the map are refined by the high-mag network. Finally, we evaluate our fast location dual magnification hard example mining network on the Camelyon16 breast cancer whole-slide image dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a 0.871 FROC score with a faster inference time, and our high magnification network also achieves a 0.88 FROC score.",

To avoid this issue, the overwhelming majority of existing approaches have to decouple the feature encoder and the MIL aggregator in MIL networks, which may largely degrade the performance. Towards this end, this paper presents a Bayesian Collaborative Learning (BCL) framework to address the memory bottleneck issue with WSI classification. Our basic idea is to introduce an auxiliary patch classifier to interact with the target MIL classifier to be learned, so that the feature encoder and the MIL aggregator in the MIL classifier can be learned collaboratively while preventing the memory bottleneck issue. Such a collaborative learning procedure is formulated under a unified Bayesian probabilistic framework and a principled Expectation-Maximization algorithm is developed to infer the optimal model parameters iteratively. As an implementation of the E-step, an effective quality-aware pseudo labeling strategy is also suggested. The proposed BCL is extensively evaluated on three publicly available WSI datasets, i.e., CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC and TCGA-RCC, achieving an AUC of 95.6%, 96.0% and 97.5% respectively, which consistently outperforms all the methods compared.

We aimed to develop a lymph node metastases diagnostic model (LNMDM) on whole slide images and to assess the clinical effect of an artificial intelligence-assisted (AI) workflow.\nIn this retrospective, multicentre, diagnostic study in China, we included consecutive patients with bladder cancer who had radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection, and from whom whole slide images of lymph node sections were available, for model development. We excluded patients with non-bladder cancer and concurrent surgery, or low-quality images. Patients from two hospitals (Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) were assigned before a cutoff date to a training set and after the date to internal validation sets for each hospital. Patients from three other hospitals (the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) were included as external validation sets. A validation subset of challenging cases from the five validation sets was used to compare performance between the LNMDM and pathologists, and two other datasets (breast cancer from the CAMELYON16 dataset and prostate cancer from the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University) were collected for a multi-cancer test.

Towards this end, this paper presents a novel weakly supervised method, termed as Prototypical Multiple Instance Learning (PMIL), to learn to predict BCLNM from WSIs with slide-level class labels only. PMIL introduces the well-established vocabulary-based multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm into computational pathology, which is characterized by utilizing the so-called prototypes to model pathological data and construct WSI features. PMIL mainly consists of two innovatively designed modules, i.e., the prototype discovery module which acquires prototypes from training data by unsupervised clustering, and the prototype-based slide embedding module which builds WSI features by matching constitutive patches against the prototypes. Relative to existing MIL methods for WSI classification, PMIL has two substantial merits: (1) being more explicit and interpretable in modeling the inter-tumoral heterogeneity in BCLNM pathological images, and (2) being more effective in identifying micro-metastases. Evaluation is conducted on two datasets, i.e., the public Camelyon16 dataset and the Zbraln dataset created by ourselves. PMIL achieves an AUC of 88.2% on Camelyon16 and 98.4% on Zbraln (at 40x magnification factor), which consistently outperforms other compared methods.

  "34705638": "Weakly-supervised learning (WSL) has recently triggered substantial interest as it mitigates the lack of pixel-wise annotations. Given global image labels, WSL methods yield pixel-level predictions (segmentations), which enable to interpret class predictions. Despite their recent success, mostly with natural images, such methods can face important challenges when the foreground and background regions have similar visual cues, yielding high false-positive rates in segmentations, as is the case in challenging histology images. WSL training is commonly driven by standard classification losses, which implicitly maximize model confidence, and locate the discriminative regions linked to classification decisions. Therefore, they lack mechanisms for modeling explicitly non-discriminative regions and reducing false-positive rates. We propose novel regularization terms, which enable the model to seek both non-discriminative and discriminative regions, while discouraging unbalanced segmentations. We introduce high uncertainty as a criterion to localize non-discriminative regions that do not affect classifier decision, and describe it with original Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence losses evaluating the deviation of posterior predictions from the uniform distribution. Our KL terms encourage high uncertainty of the model when the latter inputs the latent non-discriminative regions. Our loss integrates: (i) a cross-entropy seeking a foreground, where model confidence about class prediction is high; (ii) a KL regularizer seeking a background, where model uncertainty is high; and (iii) log-barrier terms discouraging unbalanced segmentations.

The network consists of a generator network G\nQualitative results of the images generated by our network are compared to original color distributions. Our evaluation indicates that by mapping images to a target domain, the similarity training images from that domain improves up to 96%. We also achieve a high cycle consistency for the generator networks by obtaining similarity indices greater than 0.9. When applying the CycleGAN normalization to HE-stain images from our institute the kappa-value of the ResNet-model that is only trained on Camelyon16 data is increased more than 50%.\nCycleGANs have proven to efficiently normalize HE-stained images. The approach compensates for deviations resulting from image acquisition (e.g. different scanning devices) as well as from tissue staining (e.g. different staining protocols), and thus overcomes the staining variations in images from various institutions.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/m4ln/stainTransfer_CycleGAN_pytorch . The data set supporting the solutions is available at https://doi.org/10.11588/data/8LKEZF .",
  "36113326": "Deep learning has shown its effectiveness in histopathology image analysis, such as pathology detection and classification. However, stain colour variation in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained histopathology images poses challenges in effectively training deep learning-based algorithms. To alleviate this problem, stain normalisation methods have been proposed, with most of the recent methods utilising generative adversarial networks (GAN). However, these methods are either trained fully with paired images from the target domain (supervised) or with unpaired images (unsupervised), suffering from either large discrepancy between domains or risks of undertrained/overfitted models when only the target domain images are used for training. In this paper, we introduce a colour adaptive generative network (CAGAN) for stain normalisation which combines both supervised learning from target domain and unsupervised learning from source domain. Specifically, we propose a dual-decoder generator and force consistency between their outputs thus introducing extra supervision which benefits from extra training with source domain images. Moreover, our model is immutable to stain colour variations due to the use of stain colour augmentation. We further implement histogram loss to ensure the processed images are coloured with the target domain colours regardless of their content differences. Extensive experiments on four public histopathology image datasets including TCGA-IDH, CAMELYON16, CAMELYON17 and BreakHis demonstrate that our proposed method produces high quality stain normalised images which improve the performance of benchmark algorithms by 5% to 10% compared to baselines not using normalisation.",
  "34649072": "Color variations in digital histopathology severely impact the performance of computer-aided diagnosis systems. They are due to differences in the staining process and acquisition system, among other reasons. Blind color deconvolution techniques separate multi-stained images into single stained bands which, once normalized, can be used to eliminate these negative color variations and improve the performance of machine learning tasks.\nIn this work, we decompose the observed RGB image in its hematoxylin and eosin components. We apply Bayesian modeling and inference based on the use of Super Gaussian sparse priors for each stain together with prior closeness to a given reference color-vector matrix. The hematoxylin and eosin components are then used for image normalization and classification of histological images. The proposed framework is tested on stain separation, image normalization, and cancer classification problems. The results are measured using the peak signal to noise ratio, normalized median intensity and the area under ROC curve on five different databases.\nThe obtained results show the superiority of our approach to current state-of-the-art blind color deconvolution techniques. In particular, the fidelity to the tissue improves 1,27 dB in mean PSNR. The normalized median intensity shows a good normalization quality of the proposed approach on the tested datasets. Finally, in cancer classification experiments the area under the ROC curve improves from 0.9491 to 0.9656 and from 0.9279 to 0.9541 on Camelyon-16 and Camelyon-17, respectively, when the original and processed images are used. Furthermore, these figures of merits are better than those obtained by the methods compared with.\nThe proposed framework for blind color deconvolution, normalization and classification of images guarantees fidelity to the tissue structure and can be used both for normalization and classification. In addition, color deconvolution enables the use of the optical density space for classification, which improves the classification performance.",
  "30295070": "Nodal metastasis of a primary tumor influences therapy decisions for a variety of cancers. Histologic identification of tumor cells in lymph nodes can be laborious and error-prone, especially for small tumor foci.\nTo evaluate the application and clinical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm (LYmph Node Assistant or LYNA) for detection of metastatic breast cancer in sentinel lymph node biopsies.\nWhole slide images were obtained from hematoxylin-eosin-stained lymph nodes from 399 patients (publicly available Camelyon16 challenge dataset). LYNA was developed by using 270 slides and evaluated on the remaining 129 slides. We compared the findings to those obtained from an independent laboratory (108 slides from 20 patients/86 blocks) using a different scanner to measure reproducibility.\nLYNA achieved a slide-level area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 99% and a tumor-level sensitivity of 91% at 1 false positive per patient on the Camelyon16 evaluation dataset. We also identified 2 \"normal\" slides that contained micrometastases. When applied to our second dataset, LYNA achieved an AUC of 99.6%. LYNA was not affected by common histology artifacts such as overfixation, poor staining, and air bubbles.\nArtificial intelligence algorithms can exhaustively evaluate every tissue patch on a slide, achieving higher tumor-level sensitivity than, and comparable slide-level performance to, pathologists. These techniques may improve the pathologist's productivity and reduce the number of false negatives associated with morphologic detection of tumor cells. We provide a framework to aid practicing pathologists in assessing such algorithms for adoption into their workflow (akin to how a pathologist assesses immunohistochemistry results).",

A training data set of whole-slide images from 2 centers in the Netherlands with (nâ=â110) and without (nâ=â160) nodal metastases verified by immunohistochemical staining were provided to challenge participants to build algorithms. Algorithm performance was evaluated in an independent test set of 129 whole-slide images (49 with and 80 without metastases). The same test set of corresponding glass slides was also evaluated by a panel of 11 pathologists with time constraint (WTC) from the Netherlands to ascertain likelihood of nodal metastases for each slide in a flexible 2-hour session, simulating routine pathology workflow, and by 1 pathologist without time constraint (WOTC).\nDeep learning algorithms submitted as part of a challenge competition or pathologist interpretation.\nThe presence of specific metastatic foci and the absence vs presence of lymph node metastasis in a slide or image using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The 11 pathologists participating in the simulation exercise rated their diagnostic confidence as definitely normal, probably normal, equivocal, probably tumor, or definitely tumor.\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.556 to 0.994. The top-performing algorithm achieved a lesion-level, true-positive fraction comparable with that of the pathologist WOTC (72.4% [95% CI, 64.3%-80.4%]) at a mean of 0.0125 false-positives per normal whole-slide image. For the whole-slide image classification task, the best algorithm (AUC, 0.994 [95% CI, 0.983-0.999]) performed significantly better than the pathologists WTC in a diagnostic simulation (mean AUC, 0.810 [range, 0.738-0.884]; Pâ<â.001). The top 5 algorithms had a mean AUC that was comparable with the pathologist interpreting the slides in the absence of time constraints (mean AUC, 0.960 [range, 0.923-0.994] for the top 5 algorithms vs 0.966 [95% CI, 0.927-0.998] for the pathologist WOTC).\nIn the setting of a challenge competition, some deep learning algorithms achieved better diagnostic performance than a panel of 11 pathologists participating in a simulation exercise designed to mimic routine pathology workflow; algorithm performance was comparable with an expert pathologist interpreting whole-slide images without time constraints. Whether this approach has clinical utility will require evaluation in a clinical setting."
